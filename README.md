This is the third graduation project for the [React Nanodegree Program](https://br.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) from Udacity.

For the Flashcards is a mobile app (Android or iOS - or both) that lets users study a collection of flashcards. With the app, users can create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to these decks, and make the quizes in these decks.
